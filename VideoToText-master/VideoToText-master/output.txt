There's a new one %HESITATION holding us all.
Taking place in America today the job to suppress and subvert.
Right to vote.
Fair and free elections.
It was sold on the market.
An assault on liberty.
Sold on who we are.
Who we are as Americans.
Or make no mistake.
Boys emerges your fear colors of why.
Are threatening the very foundation of our country.
Give me no pleasure to say this.
I never thought my heart forever I have to say.
But I swore no to you.
To god to preserve protect and defend the constitution.
That's another forms a sacred trust.
To defend Americans all threshold foreign and domestic something's in America should be simple and straight forward.
Perhaps the most important of those things the most fundamental of those things is the right to vote two thousand twenty.
More people vote in America than ever.
Ever in the history of American.
In the middle of a one.
And then.
No other election has ever been held.
Under such scrutiny such high standards.
The big wise yes that a big why this is the one you.
I'm saying this because you should be a long.
I'm also saying this.
There's good news.
Doesn't have to be this way.
It doesn't have to be for real.
We have the main.
I just need to will.
Will to save and strengthen our democracy.
We didn't twenty we did in the twenty twenty.
The battle for the soul of America.
In that battle the people voted.
Democracies rail.
Our constitution hello this isn't about Democrats Republicans.
It's more about who we are as Americans that basic.
It's not the kind of country we want today.
What kind of country we want for our children and grandchildren the moral.
And quite frankly the whole world is watching.
